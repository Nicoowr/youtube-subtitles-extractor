00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.480
- Just be yourself has
become sort of a statement

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.460
that people venerate these days.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.710
People celebrate just be yourself,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.500
probably because it kinda
feels like a warm hug.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.536
Just be yourself and
everything's gonna be okay.

00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:16.770
It feels kind of
empathetic, understanding.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.030
It's like, yeah, you're right.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.313
I can just be myself.

00:00:19.313 --> 00:00:20.790
That sounds fantastic.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.500
I don't have to be anything that I'm not.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.730
Just be yourself feels like
it really cares about you,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.357
despite the fact that nobody
really follows that advice

00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:31.490
because you can't really follow it.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.121
Everybody is a chameleon of sorts.

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:36.450
When you're around the boys having a beer,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.950
you're gonna act way differently

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.810
than you do when you're around your mom.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.250
When you're at a job interview,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.040
you're going to be all
proper and professional

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.780
and maybe a little bit personable,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.610
way more charming than you would

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.130
if you're just relaxing on the couch

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.110
devolving into degeneracy,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.940
trying to watch something on Netflix.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.196
We do this because we kind of have to.

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:58.324
Different situations that we're in

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:02.101
recruit different parts
of us, different emphases.

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:04.465
Sometimes we have to be professional,

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:07.170
other times we have to be
very charming and funny

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.520
like I'm doing right now.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.840
I'm not like this in real life,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.161
but I've gotta film a Better Ideas video

00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:14.490
so I sound super smart and
personable and relatable.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.510
The point I'm trying to make

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.465
is that are we ever really ourselves?

00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:21.030
What does it mean to be ourselves?

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.820
And is it something that
we should strive to be?

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.950
Because just be yourself

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.150
has become something

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.180
that we've been conditioned
to believe is true

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.650
based on repetition.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.270
Maybe the Walt Disney company

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.041
got us all believing that
we should just be ourselves,

00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:38.100
make our dreams come true,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.120
follow our heart,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.350
find our passion.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.730
All of these bubblegum,

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.340
cotton candy, birthday card sentiments

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.109
that all sound very comforting

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.330
but don't really mean anything

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.270
and are impossible to
just apply to your life.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.890
We hear these things so often,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.361
they've become utterly meaningless.

00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:57.402
Nobody's life was ever changed

00:01:57.402 --> 00:01:59.707
by somebody saying to them, "Hey,

00:01:59.707 --> 00:02:01.377
"just follow your dreams."

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.503
What does that mean?

00:02:03.503 --> 00:02:05.760
I've had some pretty
(beep) up dreams in my day.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.920
And if we were to follow those dreams,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.030
we would all be screwed.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.110
God help us all.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.763
And follow your passion,

00:02:11.763 --> 00:02:14.070
most people that you talk to

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.350
have no idea what their passion is.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.790
They have things they're interested in,

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.828
probably a bunch of things
they're interested in,

00:02:19.828 --> 00:02:22.440
but there's a lot of pressure in like, oh,

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.510
find your passion and
everything's gonna work out.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.500
There's a lot of pressure in that

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.140
because people get analysis paralysis.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.120
They have no idea which passion to pick.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.560
What's gonna be the one thing

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.420
that makes everything make sense?

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.940
And again, I think that we tend to agree

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.057
with these taglines,

00:02:37.057 --> 00:02:40.410
not because they're
particularly instructional,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.810
but because they sound
like they mean well.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.299
They're very easy to swallow.

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.165
It's never challenging or uncomfortable

00:02:47.165 --> 00:02:49.918
to believe that the answer
to all of our problems

00:02:49.918 --> 00:02:52.380
is to just be more of ourselves,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.273
whatever that means.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:55.758
But I think that just being yourself

00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:58.980
is inherently a defeatist statement

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.690
because just implies that
yourself is something to just be.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.333
It's a reality to regress back to.

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:09.827
It tells you to stop
reaching and stop pursuing

00:03:09.827 --> 00:03:13.650
and just be you because you're just you.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.895
It's an inherently pessimistic statement

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:18.600
veiled in self-congratulation.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.630
A statement that doesn't
want the best for you,

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.252
a statement that doesn't
care about your ideals,

00:03:24.252 --> 00:03:27.210
your conception of a brighter future.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.750
It's a statement that
encourages you to stop growing.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.915
But riddle me this,

00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:36.300
why just be yourself when
you can be so much more?

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.010
Now you might think to yourself, well,

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.080
I can only just be myself, right?

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.110
If I'm always striving
to be more than myself

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.450
then I will never feel okay with myself.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.950
I'll never feel comforted.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.845
I'll never feel okay with who I am,

00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:52.260
and instead I will hold this
future version of myself

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.253
in front of me like a carrot to a mule,

00:03:54.253 --> 00:03:56.040
hamster wheeling myself,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.723
I guess mule wheeling yourself
right into your grave.

00:03:59.723 --> 00:04:02.380
You'll never be able to
stop and smell the roses.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.717
You'll always be looking
for the next thing.

00:04:04.717 --> 00:04:06.088
Goals and goals and goals.

00:04:06.088 --> 00:04:08.160
And you'll be searching for a peace

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.290
that you could find in the present moment.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.090
And while I understand this argument,

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.040
I also think it's very shortsighted.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.390
It doesn't take into account

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.820
the bigger picture of the human brain,

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.680
and that is that, yes,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.550
we do need to feel satisfied
and happy with what we have.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.785
That's what serotonin and
oxytocin and endorphins are for.

00:04:27.785 --> 00:04:30.540
They're all for feeling
good in the present moment.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.120
It's a very important
system of our psychology,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.580
but potentially way more influential

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.590
and important for our survival

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.120
is our dopamine system.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.760
And dopamine is all about motivation.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.740
If somebody were to
delete all the dopamine

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.000
in your brain right now

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.592
so you couldn't feel a lick of dopamine,

00:04:47.592 --> 00:04:51.120
you would lay down in whatever
chair you're sitting on

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.330
because you'd probably not
have the motivation to sit down

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.670
and you would never lift
a finger to do anything.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.690
You would pee your pants

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.712
because you wouldn't be
motivated to go to the bathroom.

00:04:59.712 --> 00:05:01.890
You wouldn't get up to eat anything.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.810
You would literally lay there and die.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.340
We need motivation

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.520
to go get things that
we don't already have.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.190
It's the only reason why
you're alive right now.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.520
So in a way, motivation is the desire

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.456
to attain something that
we don't already have.

00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:21.510
It's something that requires
us to move in space and time

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.350
to go get,

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.120
and that will never go away, right?

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.738
We will always be
motivated to do something.

00:05:26.738 --> 00:05:30.720
The question is, what are we
locking our motivation into?

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.696
Is it Netflix?

00:05:31.696 --> 00:05:33.213
Is it social media?

00:05:33.213 --> 00:05:36.390
Is it buying frivolous things?

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.280
No judgment,

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.620
I'm just saying that it's
locked into something.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.530
So since we have this profound desire

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.320
to achieve things that we
haven't already achieved

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.020
or to get things that
we don't already have,

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.910
what better thing is there

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.679
to lock our motivation system into

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:56.730
than being the best version of ourselves

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.340
so that that we can be
more capable people,

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.851
capable of helping ourselves

00:06:00.851 --> 00:06:02.694
get through the hardships of life

00:06:02.694 --> 00:06:04.440
so that we can help others

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.420
get through the hardships in their lives,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.850
essentially making the
world a better place

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.770
through being the best we can be.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.534
So I think that two things
can be true at the same time.

00:06:13.534 --> 00:06:16.380
We can both strive for greatness

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.086
and be the best that we can be,

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:21.360
not settling for just being ourselves.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.620
But at the same time,

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.550
having honesty and compassion
for wherever we are now.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.383
But a lot of the time,

00:06:27.383 --> 00:06:31.661
we have very weird
tendencies and behaviors

00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:34.672
that we think are just
a part of who we are,

00:06:34.672 --> 00:06:36.720
but in fact they are behaviors

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.790
that we learned through trauma

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.710
or the role that we played

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.796
in our friends group or our family

00:06:42.796 --> 00:06:46.500
that lead us to do things
that don't actually serve us,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.749
they don't serve others.

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:51.330
And all in all, they're just a negative.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.656
Even though it's like,
oh, that's just me, ha-ha,

00:06:53.656 --> 00:06:55.050
you'd be surprised

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.402
how many aspects of your
personality are improvable.

00:06:59.402 --> 00:07:00.630
You might think

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.930
that it's just a little quirk
or insanity that you have,

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.526
but consider the fact
that you can improve it.

00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:12.000
You can modify your behavior
and your thought patterns

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.350
to better serve you.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.240
And things that you previously thought

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.606
were just part of your
personality or you being you

00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:20.809
are things that are just a result

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:22.590
of the way you are brought up

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.530
and things that don't actually
help you in the long run.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.280
Don't get self-compassion
confused with complacency.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.263
For instance, if you had a close friend

00:07:31.263 --> 00:07:33.540
and he kind of went off the deep end,

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.970
previously you were really good friends,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:36.930
you got along,

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.367
and then he started to
become kind of toxic.

00:07:39.367 --> 00:07:42.450
He started pushing you and others away

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.680
through his behaviors,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.525
through his words.

00:07:44.525 --> 00:07:46.740
And you're kinda like, what gives?

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.916
This guy has changed

00:07:47.916 --> 00:07:50.970
and I don't know if I wanna
be around him anymore,

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.494
but I do really care about him.

00:07:52.494 --> 00:07:54.990
But for now, I have to distance myself.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.357
If this person were to come
up to you sincerely and say,

00:07:58.357 --> 00:08:03.093
"Hey, look, I realize my
behavior was out of line.

00:08:04.027 --> 00:08:05.677
"I didn't really realize it at the time,

00:08:05.677 --> 00:08:09.119
"but it's become clear to
me that I need to change.

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:13.297
"My words and my actions are
hurting me or hurting others

00:08:13.297 --> 00:08:14.550
"and I'm ready to change."

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.817
Would you say, "No, it's okay.

00:08:15.817 --> 00:08:16.807
"Just be yourself.

00:08:16.807 --> 00:08:17.880
"You do you."

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.747
You would probably say, "I agree.

00:08:19.747 --> 00:08:21.441
"Your behavior was out of line.

00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:23.947
"I'm so glad that you can see that.

00:08:23.947 --> 00:08:25.417
"And since I care about you,

00:08:25.417 --> 00:08:29.137
"I really want to help you be
the best version of yourself

00:08:29.137 --> 00:08:31.267
"so that you can serve yourself better

00:08:31.267 --> 00:08:34.200
"and get along with everybody," right?

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.360
I want you to be the best you can be.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.330
And it's funny because loving that person

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.240
isn't just permitting
them to do their thing

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.220
and be who they are and whatever,

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.600
that's complacency.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.430
Since you care about that person,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.430
you want to help them be the
best version of themselves.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.090
I truly believe that we need
to treat ourselves like this.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.321
We need to treat ourselves
like we have inherent dignity,

00:08:57.321 --> 00:08:59.400
like we are on our own side

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.140
and we want the best for ourselves.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.160
And a lot of the time,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.280
we don't treat ourselves with
the dignity that we deserve.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.320
Our behaviors and our actions

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.930
or maybe habits or ways of thinking

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.134
or thought patterns that we have,

00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:15.270
that we've had since the dawn of time,

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.614
as long as we can remember,

00:09:16.614 --> 00:09:20.580
are proving with time to not serve us,

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.683
to be destructive.

00:09:21.683 --> 00:09:24.990
Maybe we learned these
tendencies through childhood

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.090
and they're just a part of who we are,

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.460
but they're leading us
to the brink of doom.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.893
We gain no traction in our lives.

00:09:31.893 --> 00:09:35.460
Nothing's working, should
we just be ourselves then?

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.459
So ask yourself,

00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:40.710
are you living a life that
reflects your inherent dignity?

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.280
Are your thoughts, behaviors
and habits serving you?

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.530
Who do you ideally want to be?

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.610
And what can you do to help you
become somebody of strength?

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.837
And the bizarre thing is

00:09:51.837 --> 00:09:55.500
when we start caring
more about our future,

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.820
when we have ideals,

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.190
when we have something to strive towards,

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.477
we actually start to become more satisfied

00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:02.970
with the present moment.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.950
And especially when
you've been on that path

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:05.823
for a little while,

00:10:05.823 --> 00:10:07.248
you can look to your past

00:10:07.248 --> 00:10:09.480
and you have a track record of growth.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.850
You can be comforted that
you've come a long way,

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.697
and you can be excited and motivated

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:15.690
by the person that you're becoming.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.110
Self-satisfaction can't exist in a vacuum.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.422
It's impossible to shake our concept

00:10:21.422 --> 00:10:23.910
of the true, the good and the beautiful.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.197
So maybe the answer to life
isn't to just be yourself.

00:10:27.197 --> 00:10:30.099
Maybe the answer is to
love yourself enough

00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:31.953
to become something more.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.820
A big thank you to Athletic Greens

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.380
for sponsoring this video.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.280
You guys know that AG1 is by
far my favorite supplement

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.720
on the entire planet.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.390
It just makes me feel so
good throughout the day,

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.710
I almost can't believe it.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.040
Packed with over 75 vitamins, minerals,

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.934
whole foods, sourced
super foods and adaptogens

00:10:52.934 --> 00:10:54.450
in every single scoop,

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.428
AG1 is like the mother load
of nutrition for your body.

00:10:58.428 --> 00:11:01.980
And because the ingredients
are sourced from real foods,

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.100
it has a high degree of bio availability,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.890
which means that your body
doesn't just urinate it out.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.390
It can actually soak in

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.510
and your body can deploy
it in its various systems.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.303
So I'd highly recommend joining me

00:11:14.303 --> 00:11:17.490
in this daily habit that
I do every single day

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.440
that I've been doing for about two years.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.930
So if you use my link in

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.913

actually hit the like button

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.500
because that's always a huge help.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.570
It helps the video rank better.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:58.470
It shoves my bald head into
other people's homepages,

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.520
helping them out,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.630
which helps me out.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.190
So it's a win-win for everybody.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.360
If you're lurking here

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.800
and this is the billionth time

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.470
that you've seen my face or
watched one of my videos,

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.758
consider subscribing.

00:12:08.758 --> 00:12:10.380
I don't think it does anything.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.850
I don't think it, I don't know,

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.890
maybe the algorithm likes it or something.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:14.790
Other than that,

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.080
thank you so much for watching

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.980
and we'll catch you in the next video.
